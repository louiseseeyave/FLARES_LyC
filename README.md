# Ionising properties of galaxies in the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES)
This repository contains some of the FLARES data published in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18174.

The files `flares_xiion_z_lum-2*` contain the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentile values of the ionising photon production efficiency (xiion) as a function of redshift, in bins of dust-attenuated far-UV luminosity (as shown in Figure 8 of the paper):
* 28 < log<sub>10</sub>(L<sub>FUV,dust</sub>/erg s<sup>-1</sup>Hz<sup>-1</sup>) < 28.5, which corresponds to -19.7 < M<sub>FUV</sub> < -18.4
* 28.5 < log<sub>10</sub>(L<sub>FUV,dust</sub>/erg s<sup>-1</sup>Hz<sup>-1</sup>) < 29, which corresponds to -20.9 < M<sub>FUV</sub> < -19.7
* 29 < log<sub>10</sub>(L<sub>FUV,dust</sub>/erg s<sup>-1</sup>Hz<sup>-1</sup>) < 29.5, which corresponds to -22.2 < M<sub>FUV</sub> < -20.9
* log<sub>10</sub>(L<sub>FUV,dust</sub>/erg s<sup>-1</sup>Hz<sup>-1</sup>) > 29.5, which corresponds to M<sub>FUV</sub> < -22.2

The file `flares_xiion_z_lum-all.txt` contains the 2nd, 16th, 50th, 84th and 98th percentile values of the ionising photon production efficiency (xiion) as a function of redshift for all galaxies in FLARES.
